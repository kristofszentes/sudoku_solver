## About the solver
You can change the puzzle by changing the loaded csv file in the main.py file.
You can try it with your own puzzle, you just have to create a csv file that is similar to those in the grids folder.

Some grids, like the third example in the grids folder, can take some time to be solved by the program, be patient.

If you click somewhere else during the solving phase, the program might crash and go "Not Responding" in that case it is just a display bug from pygame, it goes away when the program found the solution.
